so I want to write a blog post about Writer workflows

we get this question all the time at Writer AI Framework

first the question is what actually is a Writer Workflows?

A workflow is a sequence of connected blocks, where each block performs a specific action. Think of it like a chain reaction - when one block completes its task, it triggers the next block in line. Each connection between blocks can be either a success (green) or error (red) path, letting you control what happens next.

You can access any block's output in the next block using @{result} - this lets you pass data through your workflow steps.

one simple definition or workflow blocks are wrappers over base operations presented as python code such API, LLM calls, running loops and so on

there's a spectrum of workflows: HTTP Request Block, Set State Block, Return Value Block, Call Event Handler Block, For-Each Loop Block, Chat Completion Block, No-Code App Block, Completion Block, Parse JSON Block, Log Message Block

Writer Workflows is currently in beta, which means we're still actively improving features and adding functionality.

Workflows save time and effort by automating repetitive tasks. Once you set one up, it can run whenever needed, handling tasks consistently and reliably.

To use a state variable inside a JSON body, reference it with @{} and make sure to wrap it in quotes if you're including it as a string in the JSON. The quotes around "@{my_prompt}" are important because they signal to JSON that the value is a string, rather than treating it as raw or undefined.

And thatâ€™s it! You now have a tool that may help you to build powerful, high performance solutions and at the same time helps you to save your time!
